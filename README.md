# About

My portfolio/resume site was made using a combination of Bootstrap, HTML, JS, CSS, SCSS, and jQuery. With the help of a few open-source packages like magnific-popup, simple-line-icons, font-awesome, devicons and the site template made by [David Miller](http://davidmiller.io/).

# How to View

You should be able to access the site directly using [this link]() hosted on GitHub! :thumbsup:
